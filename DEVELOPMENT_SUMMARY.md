# Onchain Transaction Hooks System - Development Summary

## Project Overview
Building an onchain transaction hooks system on Base Sepolia testnet where users bid in perpetual auctions for the right to auto-trigger transactions in response to specific emitted logs. The system provides ~200ms execution times using Flashblocks WebSocket stream and sendRawTransactionSync API.

## Architecture Overview
- **Monorepo**: Bun + Hono + Vite + React
- **Contracts**: Foundry for smart contract development  
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum) with RainbowKit
- **Blockchain Monitoring**: Flashblocks WebSocket with brotli decompression
- **Transaction Execution**: Multicall3 contract with sendRawTransactionSync API

## Completed Systems

### 1. Project Structure & Setup
**Files Created:**
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project documentation and commands reference
- Workspace configuration for monorepo structure

**Purpose:** Established foundation for development with proper tooling and documentation.

### 2. Shared Types System
**File:** `/shared/src/types/index.ts`

**Key Types:**
- `EventSignature` - Contract event definitions with ABI
- `DetectedEvent` - Parsed blockchain events with metadata
- `VariableReference` - Variable definitions for templates (`name`, `path`, `type`)

- `TransactionTemplate` - Complete automation templates with calls and variables
- `UserWallet` - Automation wallet with encrypted private keys
- `EventHook` - User configurations linking events to templates
- `AuthSession` - SIWE authentication sessions

**Purpose:** Type-safe communication across the entire system. Uses multicall-based architecture for complex transaction sequences.

### 3. Database Schema
**File:** `/server/src/db/schema.ts`

**Tables:**
- `users` - Main wallet addresses from RainbowKit
- `userWallets` - Generated automation wallets with encrypted private keys
- `authSessions` - SIWE authentication sessions
- `eventSignatures` - Blockchain events that can be monitored
- `auctionBids` - Bids for event signature automation rights
- `eventAuctions` - Current auction state per event signature
- `transactionTemplates` - Automation templates with multicall sequences
- `eventHooks` - User configurations linking events to templates
- `detectedEvents` - Real-time events detected from blockchain
- `hookExecutions` - Logs of automated transaction executions

**Purpose:** Complete data persistence layer with proper indexing and relationships for auction system, user management, and execution tracking.

### 4. Authentication System
**Files:**
- `/server/src/auth.ts` - SIWE authentication with session management
- `/server/src/db/services/user-service.ts` - User CRUD operations
- `/server/src/db/services/auth-service.ts` - Session management

**Features:**
- SIWE message generation and verification
- Session-based authentication with expiration
- Automatic automation wallet creation (encrypted private keys)
- Balance fetching for both main and automation wallets

**Purpose:** Secure user authentication and automated wallet management for transaction execution.

### 5. Smart Contract (Auction System)
**File:** `/contracts/src/EventHookAuction.sol`

**Features:**
- User-initiated perpetual auctions (first bid creates auction)
- Event signature filtering with topic0-3 matching
- Automatic bid refunds when outbid
- Custom errors for gas optimization
- No on-chain storage of active filters (gas optimization)

**Key Functions:**
- `placeBid()` - Bid on event signature automation rights
- `getAuction()` - Get current auction state
- `getHighestBidder()` - Get current winner

**Purpose:** Decentralized auction mechanism for event signature automation rights with minimal gas costs.

### 6. Blockchain Event Monitoring
**Files:**
- `/server/src/services/flashblocks-listener.ts` - WebSocket connection to Flashblocks
- `/server/src/services/event-monitor.ts` - High-level event monitoring orchestration

**Key Features:**
- Real-time blockchain monitoring via Flashblocks WebSocket
- Brotli decompression for compressed data streams
- Correct Flashblock receipt structure handling (Eip1559/Legacy wrappers)
- Event signature matching and ABI decoding
- Database persistence of detected events
- Integration with hook execution system

**Critical Fix:** Updated to handle Flashblocks' actual receipt structure where receipts contain transaction type wrappers and simplified log structures without metadata like transactionHash/blockNumber.

**Purpose:** Real-time blockchain event detection with ~200ms latency for MEV and arbitrage applications.

### 7. Variable Resolution System
**File:** `/server/src/services/variable-resolver.ts`

**Variable Types:**
- **Event Variables**: `args.token0`, `blockNumber`, `transactionHash`, etc.
- **System Variables**: `block.number`, `block.timestamp`, `user.walletAddress`, etc.
- **User Variables**: `walletAddress` and user-specific data

**Features:**
- Dot notation path resolution (e.g., `args.token0.address`)
- BigInt to string conversion for JSON serialization
- ABI validation for event argument variables
- Path discovery for available variables per event

**Purpose:** Extract dynamic data from blockchain events to populate transaction templates.

### 8. Multicall Processing System
**File:** `/server/src/services/multicall-processor.ts`

**Features:**
- Template processing with variable substitution using `${variableName}` syntax
- Multiple transaction calls in single execution (gas optimization)
- Template validation before processing
- Pre-built templates for common operations (ERC20 transfers, Uniswap swaps)
- Gas estimation for processed multicalls

**Template Structure:**
```typescript
{
  calls: [
    {
      target: "0x...", // Contract address
      value: BigInt(0), // ETH value
      calldata: "0x...", // Encoded function call with variables
      variables: [...]   // Variable references used
    }
  ],
  requiredVariables: [...] // All variables needed for template
}
```

**Purpose:** Convert high-level automation templates into executable blockchain transactions with dynamic data injection.

### 9. Transaction Execution System
**File:** `/server/src/services/multicall-executor.ts`

**Features:**
- Multicall3 contract integration for batch execution
- sendRawTransactionSync API for ~200ms execution times
- Gas estimation and balance validation before execution
- Transaction simulation for testing before execution
- Comprehensive error handling and status tracking
- Database logging of all executions with fees and gas usage

**Execution Flow:**
1. Decrypt automation wallet private key
2. Create viem wallet client with account
3. Get nonce and gas price
4. Validate wallet balance
5. Encode multicall data for Multicall3 contract
6. Sign transaction
7. Submit via sendRawTransactionSync
8. Track execution in database

**Purpose:** Ultra-fast transaction execution with proper validation and tracking.

### 10. Hook Orchestration System

**Features:**
- Event-to-hook matching based on event signatures
- Template retrieval and processing
- Simulation before execution
- Integration with multicall executor
- Execution statistics and monitoring
- Emergency hook disable/enable functionality

**Execution Workflow:**
1. Receive detected event from Flashblocks
2. Find matching active hooks for event signature
3. Load transaction template for each hook
4. Resolve variables from event data
5. Process template into multicall
6. Simulate execution
7. Execute if simulation succeeds
8. Track results in database

**Purpose:** Orchestrates the complete automation workflow from event detection to transaction execution.

## System Workflow

### User Onboarding Flow
1. User connects wallet via RainbowKit
2. SIWE authentication creates session
3. System generates automation wallet with encrypted private key
4. User funds automation wallet for gas and transaction costs

### Auction Participation Flow
1. User finds event signature they want to automate
2. User creates transaction template (multicall sequence)
3. User places bid in auction contract for event signature rights
4. If winning bid, user's hook becomes active for that event signature

### Real-time Automation Flow
1. Flashblocks streams real-time blockchain data via WebSocket
2. Event monitor processes incoming blocks and receipts
3. Event signatures are matched against monitored events
4. For each match, hook executor finds active hooks
5. Variables are resolved from event data
6. Templates are processed into multicalls
7. Transactions are simulated for safety
8. Valid transactions are executed via sendRawTransactionSync
9. Results are tracked in database with fees and status

### Technical Execution Flow
```
Flashblocks → Event Detection → Hook Matching → Variable Resolution → 
Template Processing → Simulation → Execution → Database Tracking
```

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Correct Flashblocks Integration**: Fixed receipt structure handling for real-world Flashblocks data
2. **Multicall Architecture**: Supports complex transaction sequences in single execution
3. **Variable System**: Dynamic data injection from blockchain events into transactions
4. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript type system across entire stack
5. **Database Integration**: Comprehensive tracking and persistence layer
6. **Ultra-fast Execution**: ~200ms execution times using sendRawTransactionSync
7. **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and status tracking
8. **Gas Optimization**: Batch transactions and validate before execution

## Next Steps (Pending Tasks)

### High Priority
1. **Proxy Execution Contract**: Design multicall contract with fee collection mechanism
2. **Auction Contract Integration**: Service to monitor auction events and sync database

### Medium Priority  
1. **React Frontend**: Transaction template builder with visual interface
2. **Template Management**: CRUD operations for transaction templates
3. **Auction UI**: Interface for bidding on event signatures
